Devops with AWS
DevOps is a term that refers to the combination of development and operations skills. DevOps is preferred to overcome the long, time-consuming procedure of traditional waterfall methods. Many organisations are looking for engineers with DevOps experience these days. DevOps combines development and operations, including both software developers and the IT industry. DevOps engineers must work together and manage an automated infrastructure, workflow, and continuous application performance evaluation.

DevOps Engineering Phases: There are three phases of DevOps engineering:
1. Testing which is automated
2. Compatibility
3. Packaging

DevOps lifecycle:
The development component of DevOps is mostly focused on planning, coding, building, and testing. The operational component has been included, which comprises releasing, deployment, operation, and monitoring. The life cycle is made up of two parts: development and operation.

DevOps team members: 
DevOps engineers build and deploy software in corporate companies. In an enterprise setting, the major goal of this team is to develop a high-quality product in a short period.

A person who has worked as a front runner for the organisation will lead the team based on the company's beliefs and values. DevOps uses an automated architecture that comes with a set of rules, and a person who has worked as a front runner for the organisation will lead the team based on the company's beliefs and values.

The following abilities are needed of a Senior DevOps engineer:

Software Testing: As the number of lines of code grows, so does the need to test, deploy, and monitor the entire process.
Experience assurance: The individual develops the final product based on the customer's concept.
Security Engineer: The security engineering tools to be utilised in the security requirements during the development process.
On-time deployment: The engineer must make certain that the product is compatible and operational at the client's end.
Engineer for Product Performance: Ensures that the product works properly.

The function of a release engineer is to oversee the management and coordination of a product from development to production. To support continuous delivery and maintenance of end-end applications, release guarantees the coordination, integration, and flow of development, testing, and deployment.

System Administrator: Traditionally, system administrators are primarily concerned with keeping the server up and operating. However, DevOps is in charge of open source experts that are passionate about technology and have hands-on experience with development platforms and tools. They look after the networks, servers, and databases, as well as providing assistance.

Application of DevOps tools

Jenkins is a powerful application tool that allows the code from the repository using the git plugin and builds it using tools like Ant or Maven. Selenium is an open source automation tool that is used to develop the source code by developers and sent to the Git repository, where we have to edit the code in the repository. Selenium is a regression and functional testing tool. The code from Jenkins is tested using Selenium.

Jenkins sends the code for deployment on the production server once it has been tested using Puppet, a configuration management and deployment tool. After Jenkins is finished, it is monitored using the Nagios tools. Docker containers provide a testing environment for the build features once the monitoring process is completed.

The most often used DevOps tools
Git is a tool for version control.
Continuous Integration Testing technologies such as Jenkins and Selenium utilise preset frameworks.
Configuration management and deployment technologies like Puppet, Chef, and Ansible are available.
Nagios is a tool for continuous monitoring.
Docker is a container management system.
DevOps recruiters should have a fundamental understanding of basic methods such as agile, continuous delivery, continuous integration, micro services, test driven development, and infrastructure as code.
They should be familiar with fundamental programming languages including Bash, Python, Ruby, Perl, and PHP.
Infrastructure automation codes such as puppet, chef, Ansible, Salt, Terraform, Cloud formation, and source code management codes such as Git, Mercurial, and Subversion must be known by the recruiters.
Cloud services such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and open stack should be studied by developers.
Orchestration is another talent. Containers, a type of OS virtualization that allows you to execute an application and its dependencies in resource-isolated processes, are the next step in programming. LXD and Docker are included.
Recruiters should be able to manage many projects at the same time and be familiar with continuous integration and delivery tools.

Cruise control, Jenkins, Bamboo, Travis CI, GOCD, Team foundation server, Team city, and CircleCI are just a few examples.
Test Complete, TestingWhiz, Serverspec, Testinfra, In Spec, and Customer Driven Contracts are examples of testing tools. Prometheus, Nagios, Icinga, Zabbix, Splunk, ELK Stack, gathered, CloudWatch, and Open Zipkin are examples of monitoring technologies that recruiters should be familiar with.

Conclusion:
In this document, we go through the fundamentals of DevOps. It covers the phases, duties, and, lastly, the lifespan and tool and skill utilisation for recruiters.
